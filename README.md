#PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Boat Rental Application is a comprehensive solution designed to simplify boat rental management for businesses and enhance the booking experience for customers. The following steps outline the core processes and functionalities of the application:

1. Database Setup:
   - Initialized the SQLite database to store the boat and customer information.
   - Created tables for key data entities, including Administrators, Boat Info, Customers, and Reservations.

2. CRUD Operations:
   - Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each data entity:
     - *Administrators*: Allows the addition, modification, and removal of administrator accounts.
     - *Boats*: Enables the management of boat inventory, including adding new boats and updating boat details.
     - *Customers*: Facilitates the management of customer information, including additions, updates, and deletions.
     - *Reservations*: Provides tools for making and managing reservations, including reservation creation, modification, and deletion.

3. Data Import:
   - Utilized a CSV file import feature to efficiently populate the Boat Info table with initial boat details.
   
4. Availability Check:
   - Implemented a method to check the availability of a boat before allowing the creation of a reservation. This ensures that a boat is not already reserved for the specified date and time.

5. User Interface:
   - Developed an intuitive and user-friendly interface for customers to:
     - Browse available boats.
     - View rental prices.
     - Make reservations by selecting a boat, specifying dates, and providing necessary details.

6. Data Privacy and Security:
   - Prioritized data privacy and security by securely encrypting sensitive information, such as passwords and personal data.
   - Restrict access to sensitive data to authorized personnel only, minimizing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

7. Ethical Data Handling:
   - Implemented ethical data usage practices that respect customer privacy and ensure responsible handling of customer information.

8. Cybersecurity Measures:
   - Incorporated rigorous data validation and sanitization mechanisms to bolster the application's security against cyber threats.

9. Code Documentation:
   - Enhanced code documentation with extensive inline comments, providing insights into functions, classes, and critical logic blocks. This promotes collaboration among developers and simplifies code maintenance.

The Boat Rental Application is designed to be a holistic, secure, and user-centric solution for both boat rental businesses and their customers. It streamlines boat management, enhances the booking process, and upholds ethical data handling practices, all while prioritizing data security and privacy. This comprehensive approach ensures a seamless and responsible boat rental experience for all parties involved.
